Then open Youtube and play any song you like. Start playing your song at 1:19, then play it until 2:30. (79 seconds) Do not open replit while playing your song. Stay on the Youtube tab. Once the song has reached 2:30, pause the song, close the tab, and then come back to replit. Refresh replit, and you will see a notifacation that says "Claim 1,000,000 robux?" You will have the option to click Yes or No. If you click yes, then 1,000,000 robux will automatically be transferred to your Roblox account. If you click no, then the pop-up goes away and you don't get 1,000,000 robux. ⚠️!THIS IS A ONCE A LIFETIME OPPERUINITY, IF YOU SAY NO, YOU CANT DO IT AGAIN!⚠️
