<h3>Dehli is the capital of India</h3>
<h3>Bejing is the capital of China</h3>
<h3>Paris is the capital of France</h3>
<h3>Madrid is the capital of Spain</h3>
<h3>Athens is the capital of Greece</h3>
<h3>Ottawa is the capital of Canada</h3>
<h3>Tokyo is the capital of Japan</h3>
<h3>Seoul is the capital of Korea</h3>
<h3>Moscow is the capital Russia</h3>
<h3>Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh</h3>
<h3>Washington D.C is the capital of America</h3>
<p id = a>Across the globe, every nation maintains a designated capital city, 
    which serves as its primary seat of government and administrative hub. While many capitals, such as Paris, France, Tokyo, Japan, and Washington, D.C., USA, 
    are also the largest or most prominent urban centers in their respective countries, this is not a universal rule.
    <br>
    <p id = b>For instance, the capital of Australia is Canberra, not the more populous Sydney or Melbourne. 
        Similarly, Brazil moved its capital from the coastal Rio de Janeiro to the planned inland city of Brasília in 1960 to encourage interior development. 
        This diversity in size and location highlights the unique historical and political factors that determine where a country chooses to establish its central government.</p>
